## Bugs to correct
* A Person should be able to touch in a station if balance is >=2 (currently not possible if balance = 2).
* A Person shouldn't be able to touch in several times in a row without touching out first.
* Trains are initialized "nowhere" at the moment (should be at a station?)
* Stations don't have a maximum capacity.

## Other comments
* Passengers don't have free will. It's the responsibility of stations and trains to move them. 
How would the system work if it was the passengers' responsibility to decide to board or exit a train?
Shouldn't a person know where he is (in a station, in a train)?

* Trains don't explicitely stop at stations. One of the requirements is that passengers should be able to board
and exit a train only if it is stopped at a station. Check if this requirement is met?
